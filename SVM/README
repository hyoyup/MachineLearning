Run in Command-line:
	python svm.py

LearningRate: 0.01
C for regularization: 10
Number of iterations for training: 1000




- One concern about visualization, specifically drawing the line between the data points.

- As commented in svm.py(line:179), idea was :
	Given sepal_len, output sepal_wid

	using w^T*x + b = 1, solve for f(sepal_len) = sepal_wid
	
	So, 
	
	f(sep_len) = (-b - w[3]*pet_wid_avg - w[2]*pet_len_avg - sep_len*w[0]) / w[1] - 1
